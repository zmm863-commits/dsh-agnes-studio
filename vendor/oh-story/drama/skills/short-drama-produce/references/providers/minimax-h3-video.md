# MiniMax H3 video adapter

Adapter command:

```json
{"command": ["python3", "/absolute/path/provider_adapters.py", "minimax-h3"], "timeout_seconds": 3600}
```

Required environment:

- `MINIMAX_API_KEY`: MiniMax API key.
- `MINIMAX_VIDEO_MODEL`: the exact enabled model ID. There is intentionally no default; the adapter
  never assumes which MiniMax video release an account has.
- `MINIMAX_VIDEO_RESOLUTIONS`: comma-separated subset the configured model actually accepts, drawn
  from `480P`, `768P`, `2K`. The published envelopes differ per release, so this is configuration,
  not a constant.
- `MINIMAX_VIDEO_MIN_DURATION` and `MINIMAX_VIDEO_MAX_DURATION`: the configured model's explicit
  inclusive duration range in whole seconds. Set both or neither; a job carrying `duration` without
  the profile fails closed.

Optional environment:

- `MINIMAX_VIDEO_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.minimax.io/v2`)
- `MINIMAX_VIDEO_RATIOS`: comma-separated subset of `adaptive`, `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `9:16`, `16:9`,
  `21:9`.
- `MINIMAX_VIDEO_POLL_INTERVAL` (default `5` seconds)
- `MINIMAX_VIDEO_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `1800` seconds)

The job must have modality `video` and exactly one `.mp4` output. `duration` and `resolution` are
required and are only accepted when the runtime profile above permits their values. `ratio` is
optional for reference-conditioned jobs and **required** for text-to-video, where `adaptive` is
refused because there is no reference frame to adapt to.

The adapter validates and forwards `duration`; it does not estimate speech length or retime dialogue.
Before preparing a speaking shot, compare the accepted shot duration, the prompt's spoken timeline,
and the job's `duration`. Resolve insufficient speaking time in the storyboard and regenerate the
dependent prompt before preparing the job. Prompt timestamps alone do not change the request duration.
The official video API has no separate speech-rate parameter.

The prompt is compiled into one `text` item of the multimodal `content` array and is refused above
7000 characters. Each declared reference becomes one further `content` item carrying an explicit
`role`: `first_frame`, `last_frame`, `reference_image`, `reference_video`, or `reference_audio`.
Set the job's `parameters.prompt_language` to the resolved video-prompt language; the compiler
consumes it when appending reference semantics and does not send it as a MiniMax request field.
`first_frame` and `last_frame` may each appear once. The published envelope also caps reference
conditioning at 9 `reference_image`, 3 `reference_video` and 3 `reference_audio` items, with video and
audio clips between 2 and 15 seconds each and at most 15 seconds in total per modality; the compiler
does not count them, so a configuration that can exceed those numbers has to bound them itself.
frame conditioning (`first_frame` / `last_frame`) and full-reference conditioning
(`reference_image` / `reference_video` / `reference_audio`) are mutually exclusive in one request.
For continuation, bind the previous actual video as `reference_video` and its actual tail as
`reference_image`; the compiler labels them `<Video 1>` and `<Picture 1>` in its appended contract.
Never relabel that tail as `first_frame` while a reference video is present. Reference URLs may be HTTPS, `mm_file://{file_id}`, or a `data:<mime>;base64,<...>` URI — all three
are documented inputs. A project-relative reference in the confirmed job is read from disk and sent
inline as a data URI, so binding an image in the creator documents is enough to run the job; no
upload service is required. Each file's bytes must match the media type its extension claims, and
the published per-modality caps apply: 30MB per image, 50MB per video, 15MB per audio clip, and 64MB
for the whole request measured after base64 expansion. A reference past those caps fails closed with
an explicit message; host it and bind an HTTPS URL instead of splitting it.

Each reference takes its provider role from the confirmed job's `reference_bindings[].role`, which is
where the creator document's `用途` is translated for this provider. A job that carries references
without those bindings fails closed rather than guessing a role.

The adapter creates an asynchronous task with `POST {base}/video_generation`, polls
`GET {base}/query/video_generation/{task_id}` until a terminal state, and downloads `task.content.url` into a private temporary directory. Any unknown
status fails closed.

## What this model changes for the prompt itself

This release generates audio in the same pass as the picture. Its direct prompt dialect is also
structured: base/first-frame/first-last-frame tasks use `integrated_multimodal_description`,
`overall_soundscape`, and `non_diegetic_music`; full-reference tasks use the six-section H3 reference
form. Chinese dialogue remains exact inside `<d>[Chinese] ...</d>`. Full details live in the
video-prompt skill's `references/minimax-h3.md`.

State the intended sound layers in the prompt. For no non-diegetic music, the
H3 dialect uses `non_diegetic_music: N/A`; small probes observed unwanted music
when this layer was omitted. They did not establish that omitted speech or
negative clauses cause extra dialogue.

Follow the project's subtitle and in-scene-text policy. Prompt wording belongs
to the video-prompt skill and the declared language, not to adapter-generated
boilerplate.
