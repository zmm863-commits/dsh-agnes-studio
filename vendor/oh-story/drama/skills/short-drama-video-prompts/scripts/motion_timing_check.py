"""Check explicit motion segment timing against accepted shot duration (`VID-04`).

`VID-04` is arithmetic, and it is violated in two directions that fail
differently:

* **Overflow** — segments extend past the accepted duration. Whatever falls
  outside is truncated, taking the closing action, the verbatim dialogue tail
  and the end pose with it.
* **Shortfall** — segments stop short. The unallocated remainder does not
  render as a held frame; the execution end fills it with motion, expression or
  camera movement that has no upstream source at all.

Both are the same rule, so both are reported under the same ID with distinct
diagnostic codes. Relative timing plans are out of scope by contract: only a
plan that declares itself `explicit` makes a checkable arithmetic claim.

The script reads accepted creator files and writes nothing.
